1. The articulation_points() method of Graph will not work on networks
   of Bio::Seq objects so it can't be used. This method does work on
   networks composed of "simpler" objects, like Digest::MD5. The
   author of Graph, Jarkko Hietaniemi, does not know why this is but
   he hasn't looked into it carefully either.
