=head1 NAME

Bio::Network::IO::psi::intact - module to handle variations
in PSI MI format from the IntAct database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Do not use this module directly, use Bio::Network::IO. For example:

  my $io = Bio::Network::IO->new(-format => 'psi',
                                 -source => 'intact',
                                 -file   => 'data.xml');

  my $network = $io->next_network;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are slight differences between PSI MI files offered by various public 
databases. The Bio::Network::IO::psi* modules have methods for handling
these variations. To load a module like this use the optional "-source" 
argument when creating a new Bio::Network::IO object.
