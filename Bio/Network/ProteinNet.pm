=head1 NAME

Bio::Network::ProteinNet - a representation of a protein interaction graph.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Read in from file
  my $graphio = Bio::Network::IO->new(-file   => 'human.xml',
                                      -format => 'psi25');
  my $graph = $graphio->next_network();

  my @edges = $gr->edges;

  for my $edge (@edges) {
    for my $node ($edge->[0],$edge->[1]) {
      my @proteins = $node->proteins;
      for my $protein (@proteins) {
        print $protein->display_id," ";
      }
    }
  }

=head1 Perl Graph module

The bioperl-network package uses Perl's Graph module and it's essential
that version .80 or greater be installed.

=head2 Working with Nodes

A Node object represents either a protein or a protein complex. Nodes can
be retrieved through their identifiers:

  # Get a node (represented by a sequence object) from the graph.
  my $node = $graph->get_nodes_by_id('UniProt:P12345');

  # A node that's a protein can be treated just like a Sequence object
  print $node->seq;

  # Remove a node by specifying its identifier
  $graph->remove_nodes($graph->get_nodes_by_id('UniProt:P12345'));

  # How many nodes are there?
  my $ncount = $graph->nodes();

  # Get interactors of your favourite protein
  my $node = $graph->get_nodes_by_id('RefSeq:NP_023232');
  my @neighbors = $graph->neighbors($node); 
  print "      NP_023232 interacts with ";
  print join " ,", map{$_->primary_id()} @neighbors;
  print "\n";

  # Annotate your sequences with interaction info
  my @seq_objects = ($seq1, $seq2, $seq3);
  for my $seq (@seq_objects) {
    if ( $graph->get_nodes_by_id($seq->accession_number) ) {
       my $node = $graph->get_nodes_by_id( $seq->accession_number);
       my @neighbors = $graph->neighbors($node);
       for my $n (@neighbors) {
          my $ft = Bio::SeqFeature::Generic->new(
                    -primary_tag => 'Interactor',
                    -tag         => { id => $n->accession_number }
                   );
          $seq->add_SeqFeature($ft);
        }
     }
  }

  # Get proteins with > 10 interactors
  my @nodes = $graph->nodes();
  my @hubs;
  for my $node (@nodes) {
    if ($graph->neighbors($node) > 10) {
       push @hubs, $node;
    }
  }
  print "the following proteins have > 10 interactors:\n";
  print join "\n", map {$_->primary_id()} @hubs;

  # Get clustering coefficient of a given node.
  my $id = "RefSeq:NP_023232";
  my $cc = $graph->clustering_coefficient($graph->get_nodes_by_id($id));
  if ($cc != -1) {  ## result is -1 if cannot be calculated
    print "CC for $id is $cc";
  }

=head2 Working with Edges

  # How many edges are there?
  my $ecount = $graph->edges;

  # Get all the paired nodes, or edges, in the graph as an array
  my @edges = $graph->edges

=head2 Working with Interactions

  # How many interactions are there?
  my $icount = $graph->interactions;

  # Retrieve all interactions
  my @interx = $graph->interactions;

  # Get interactions above a threshold confidence score
  for my $interx (@interx) {
	 if ($interx->weight > 0.6) {
		 print $interx->primary_id, "\t", $interx->weight, "\n";
	 }
  }

=head2 Working with Graphs

  # Get graph density
  my $density = $graph->density();

  # Get connected sub-graphs
  my @graphs = $graph->connected_components();

  # Copy interactions from one graph to another
  $graph1->add_interactions_from($graph2);


=head2 Creating networks from your own data

If you have interaction data in your own format, e.g. 

  <interaction id>  <protein id 1>  <protein id 2>  <score>

A simple approach would look something like this:

  my $io = Bio::Root::IO->new(-file => 'mydata');
  my $graph = Bio::Network::ProteinNet->new(refvertexed => 1);

  while (my $l = $io->_readline() ) {
     my ($id, $nid1, $nid2, $sc) = split /\s+/, $l;

     my $prot1 = Bio::Seq->new(-accession_number => $nid1);
     my $prot2 = Bio::Seq->new(-accession_number => $nid2);

     # create new Interaction object based on an id and weight
     my $interaction = Bio::Network::Interaction->new(-id   => $id,
                                                    -weight => $sc );
     $graph->add_interaction(-nodes => [($prot1,$prot2)]),
                             -interaction => $interaction );
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A ProteinNet is a representation of a protein interaction network.
Its functionality comes from the L<Graph> module of Perl and from BioPerl,
the nodes or vertices in the network are Sequence objects.

=head2 Nodes

A node is one or more BioPerl sequence objects, a L<Bio::Seq> or 
L<Bio::Seq::RichSeq> object. Essentially the graph can use any objects 
that implement L<Bio::AnnotatableI> and L<Bio::IdentifiableI> interfaces 
since these objects hold useful identifiers. This is relevant since the 
identity of nodes is determined by their identifiers.

=head2 Interactions and Edges

Since bioperl-network is built on top of the L<Graph> and L<Graph::Undirected> 
modules of Perl it uses its formal model as well. An Edge corresponds to a 
pair of nodes, and there is only one Edge per pair. An Interaction is an 
attribute of an Edge, and there can be 1 or more Interactions per Edge. So

  $ecount = $network->edges

Tells you how many paired nodes there are and

  $icount = $network->interactions

Tells you how many node-node interactions there are. An Interaction is 
equivalent to one experiment or one experimental observation. 

=head1 FOR DEVELOPERS

In this module, the nodes or vertexes are represented by L<Bio::Seq>
objects containing database identifiers but usually
without sequence, since the data is parsed from protein-protein
interaction data.

Interactions should be L<Bio::Network::Interaction> objects, which are 
L<Bio::IdentifiableI> implementing objects. At present Interactions only 
have an identifier and a weight() method, to hold confidence data.

A ProteinNet object has the following internal data, aside from the data
structures of Graph itself:

=over 2

=item _id_map

Look-up hash ('_id_map') for finding a node using any of its ids. The keys
are standard identifiers (e.g. "GenBank:A12345") and the values are 
memory addresses used by Graph (e.g. "Bio::Network::Node=HASH(0x1bc53e4)"). 

=item _interx_id_map

Look-up hash for Interactions ('_interx_id_map'),used for retrieving an 
Interaction object using an identifier.  The keys are primary ids of the 
Interaction (e.g. "DIP:2341E") and the values are addresses of 
Interactions (e.g. "Bio::Network::Interaction=HASH(0x1bc46f2)"). 

=back

The function of these hashes is either to facilitate fast lookups or 
to cache data.

=head1 API CHANGES

These modules were first released as part of the core BioPerl package
and were called Bio::Graph. Bio::Graph was copied to a separate package,
bioperl-network, and renamed Bio::Network. All of the modules were
revised and a new module, Interaction.pm, was added. The
functionality of the PSI MI parser, IO/psi.pm, was significantly
enhanced.

Graph manipulation in Bio::Graph was based on the Bio::Graph::SimpleGraph 
module by Nat Goodman. The first release as a separate package, 
bioperl-network, replaced SimpleGraph with the Perl Graph package. Other 
API changes were also made, partly to keep nomenclature consistent with 
BioPerl, partly to use the terms used by the interaction databases, and 
partly to accomodate the differences between Graph and 
Bio::Graph::SimpleGraph.

The advantages to using Graph are that Bioperl developers are not
responsible for maintaining the code that actually handles graph
manipulation and there is more functionality in Graph than in SimpleGraph.

The disadvantage is that we now rely on others to keep the package bug-free,
and there are some bugs in Graph. You should use version .80 or greater 
but even this version is not free of bugs (a list of known bugs 
can be found in the BUGS file in this package).

=over 13

=item Bio::Graph::Edge

Bio::Graph::Edge has been replaced by Bio::Network::Interaction
and Bio::Network::Edge 

=item next_graph()

This method has been replaced by next_network().

=item union()

The union() method has been removed since it was not performing a true
union. It has been replaced by L<add_interaction_from>

=item remove_nodes()

remove_nodes() is now an alias to Graph::delete_vertices

=item _get_ids_by_db() 

_get_ids_by_db() has been renamed L<get_ids_by_node>

=item add_node()

add_node() is now an alias to Graph::add_vertex

=item components()

components() is now an alias to Graph::connected_components

=item edge_count()

edge_count() is now an alias to Graph::edges

=item node_count() 

node_count() is now an alias to Graph::vertices

=item nodes_by_id() 

nodes_by_id() is now an alias to L<get_nodes_by_id>

=item edge_by_id() 

This method has been removed since edges no longer have identifiers,
Interactions do. Use L<get_interaction_by_id>

=item unconnected_nodes() 

unconnected_nodes() is now an alias to Graph::isolated_vertices

=item object_id()

object_id() is now an alias to Interaction::primary_id()

=head2 add_interactions_from

 Name        : add_interactions_from
 Purpose     : To copy interactions from one graph to another
 Usage       : $graph1->add_interactions_from($graph2)
 Returns     : void
 Arguments   : A Graph object of the same class as the calling object. 
 Description : This method copies interactions from the graph passed as the 
               argument to the calling graph. To take account of 
               differing IDs identifying the same protein, all ids are
               compared. The following rules are used:

         1. If a pair of nodes exist in both graphs then:
            a. No Interactions with the same primary id will be copied
               from $graph2 to $graph1.
            b. All other Interactions from $graph2 will be copied
               to $graph1, even if these nodes do not interact in $graph1.

         2. Nodes are never copied from $graph2 to $graph1. This is rather 
            conservative but prevents the problem of having duplicated,
            identical nodes in $graph1 due to the same protein being identified 
            by different ids in the 2 graphs.

         So, for example 

              Interaction   N1    N2   Comment

    Graph 1:  E1            P1    P2
              E2            P3    P4
              E3            P1    P4

    Graph 2:  E1            P1    P2   E1 will not be copied to Graph1
              X2            P1    P3   X2 will be copied to Graph 1
              X3            P1    P4   X3 will be copied to Graph 1
              X4            Z4    Z5   Nothing copied to Graph1

         There are measures one could take to allow copying nodes from $graph2
         to $graph1, currently unimplemented:

         1. Use sequence, if available, and some threshold measure of similarity,
            or length, to prove that proteins are not identical and can be copied.

         2. Use species information. For example, if $graph1 is entirely composed
            of human proteins then any non-human proteins could be copied to
            $graph1 without risk (and cross-species interactions are fairly common
            due the nature of interaction experiments).

         3. Use namespace or dataspace when assessing identity. For example, assume
            that all nodes in $graph1 are identified by Swissprot ids. Assume a 
            protein in $graph2 is also identified by a Swissprot id, not found in
            $graph1. This could be reasonable grounds for allowing the protein in
            $graph2 to be copied to $graph1.

          4. Some combination of the above.
