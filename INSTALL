bioperl-network Installation

1. Requirements
2. Installing bioperl-network (Unix or Cygwin)

1. Requirements 

Perl 5.6.1 is required, but 5.8 or greater is recommended.

The bioperl-network package depends on the core BioPerl package. See  
the BioPerl INSTALL file for instructions for downloading and installing 
BioPerl. You should install at least the corresponding version of Bioperl: 
since this is bioperl-network 1.6, bioperl 1.6 or greater is recommended.

bioperl-network also depends on Perl's Graph package. See CPAN at 
www.perl.org for instructions on downloading and installing Graph,
use Graph version .86 or greater.

Reading PSI XML files using bioperl-network requires the XML::Twig 
module. See CPAN at www.perl.org for instructions on downloading 
and installing XML::Twig.

2. Installing bioperl-network (Unix, Mac OS X and Cygwin)
  
Using CPAN:

    cpan>install C/CJ/CJFIELDS/BioPerl-network-1.6.0.tar.gz
 
Manual installation:

    >gunzip bioperl-network-<release-version>.tar.gz
    >tar xvf bioperl-network-<release-version>.tar
    >cd bioperl-network
    
where <release-version> is the current release.
    
    >perl Build.PL
    
You can run regression tests and install bioperl-network using the
following commands:
    
    >./Build test  
    >./Build install

You may have to have root privileges in order to run './Build install' 
successfully on Unix. See the BioPerl INSTALL file for alternative approaches
if you don't have root or administrative privileges.
