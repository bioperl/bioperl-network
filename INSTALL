bioperl-network Installation

REQUIREMENTS 

Perl 5.6.1 is required, but 5.8 or greater is recommended.

The bioperl-network package depends on the core BioPerl package. See  
the BioPerl INSTALL file (http://bioperl.org/INSTALL.html) for instructions 
for downloading and installing BioPerl. You should install at least the 
corresponding version of Bioperl: since this is bioperl-network 1.6, bioperl 
1.6 or greater is recommended.

bioperl-network also requires Perl's Graph package, https://metacpan.org/pod/Graph

Reading PSI XML files using bioperl-network requires the XML::Twig 
module. See https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Twig.
