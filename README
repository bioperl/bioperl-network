1. Installation

See the accompanying INSTALL file for details on installing
bioperl-network.


2. Introduction

A ProteinNet is a representation of a protein-protein interaction network.
Its functionality comes from the Graph module of Perl and from BioPerl,
as the nodes or vertices in a ProteinNet network are Sequence objects.

A node or vertex is one or more BioPerl sequence objects, a Bio::Seq or 
Bio::Seq::RichSeq object. Essentially the node can be any Bioperl object 
that implement Bio::AnnotatableI and Bio::IdentifiableI interfaces 
since these objects hold useful identifiers. This is relevant since the 
identity of nodes is determined by their identifiers.

Since a node can contain more than one Sequence objects it can
represent protein complexes as well as proteins.

As bioperl-network is built on top of the Perl's Graph::Undirected 
modules it uses its formal model as well. An Edge corresponds to a 
pair of nodes, and there is only one Edge per pair. An Interaction is an 
attribute of an Edge, and there can be 1 or more Interactions per Edge.
An Interaction can be thought of as one experiment or one experimental 
observation. 

For more detailed documentation please see the
Bio::Network::ProteinNet module.


3. Status

This package should be considered a preliminary piece of
work. Although the code is tested and stable it lacks functionality. Not
all fields in the PSI MI standard are parsed into a network, for example.
In addition useful functions such as searching by sequence or ontology
term aren't yet implemented. If you are interested in contributing
please contact Brian Osborne at bioperl-l@bioperl.org.


4. History

Modules similar to these were first released as part of the core BioPerl package
and were called Bio::Graph*. Bio::Graph was copied to a separate package,
bioperl-network, and renamed Bio::Network. All of the modules were
revised and a new module, Interaction.pm, was added. The
functionality of the PSI MI parser, IO/psi.pm, was significantly
enhanced.

Graph manipulation in the predecessor Bio::Graph was based on the 
Bio::Graph::SimpleGraph module by Nat Goodman. The first release as a
separate package, bioperl-network, replaced SimpleGraph with the Perl
Graph package. Other API changes were also made, partly to keep
nomenclature consistent with BioPerl, partly to use the terms used by
the public protein interaction databases, and partly to accommodate the
differences between Graph and Bio::Graph::SimpleGraph.

The advantages to using Graph are that Bioperl developers are not
responsible for maintaining the code that actually handles graph
manipulation and there is more functionality in Graph than in SimpleGraph.

The disadvantage is that we now rely on others to keep the package bug-free.
You must install version .80 or greater but even this version is not
completely bug-free (see the BUGS file in this package for details).
